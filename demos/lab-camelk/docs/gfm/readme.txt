Notice:

The tutorial was original written for RHPDS (Red Hat Product Demo System).
RHPDS uses Liquid templating which requires the documentation to have a special Markdown format which renders ugly and out of place if viewed from GitLab or GitHub.

This documentation folder includes the tutorial in GFM format.

GFM stands for: Gitlab Flavored Markdown.

	Check GitLab's documentation:
	https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gitlab-flavored-markdown-gfm

The documentation is a duplicate of the RHPDS one. This means it might not be fully in sync.
Also, it might contain instructions for running certain instructions not necessary in RHPDS.
